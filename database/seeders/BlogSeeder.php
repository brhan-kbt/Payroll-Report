## What is Laravel?

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. It attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- Authentication
- Routing
- Sessions
- Caching
- Database operations

## Key Features

### Eloquent ORM
Laravel\'s Eloquent ORM provides a beautiful, simple ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table.

### Blade Templating
Blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine provided with Laravel. Unlike other popular PHP templating engines, Blade does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your views.

### Artisan Console
Artisan is the command-line interface included with Laravel. It provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your application.

## Getting Started

To get started with Laravel, you\'ll need to install it using Composer:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel my-blog
cd my-blog
php artisan serve
```

This will create a new Laravel project and start the development server.',
                'category_id' => $createdCategories[3]->id, // Laravel category
                'user_id' => $user->id,
                'views' => 150,
                'likes' => 25,
            ],
            [
                'title' => 'Modern JavaScript ES6+ Features',
                'subtitle' => 'Explore the latest JavaScript features that every developer should know',
                'body' => 'JavaScript has evolved significantly over the years, and ES6+ (ES2015 and later) introduced many powerful features that make JavaScript development more efficient and enjoyable.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions:

```javascript
// Traditional function
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Arrow function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

## Destructuring Assignment

Destructuring allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables:

```javascript
// Array destructuring
const [first, second, third] = [1, 2, 3];

// Object destructuring
const { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 30 };
```

## Template Literals

Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings:

```javascript
const name = "World";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

## Promises and Async/Await

Modern JavaScript provides powerful tools for handling asynchronous operations:

```javascript
// Using Promises
fetch("/api/data")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));

// Using async/await
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch("/api/data");
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

These features make JavaScript more powerful and easier to work with in modern web development.',
                'category_id' => $createdCategories[4]->id, // JavaScript category
                'user_id' => $user->id,

                'body' => 'Responsive web design is crucial in today\'s multi-device world. With users accessing websites from various devices with different screen sizes, creating responsive applications is no longer optionalâ€”it\'s essential.

## Mobile-First Approach

Start designing for mobile devices first, then progressively enhance for larger screens:

```css
/* Mobile-first CSS */
.container {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 1rem;
}

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        max-width: 750px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
}

/* Desktop and up */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    .container {
        max-width: 1200px;
    }
}
```

## Flexible Grid Systems

Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create flexible layouts:

```css
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    gap: 2rem;
}

.flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
```

## Responsive Images

Ensure images scale properly across devices:

```html
<img src="image.jpg"
     srcset="image-small.jpg 480w, image-medium.jpg 768w, image-large.jpg 1200w"
     sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"
     alt="Responsive image">
```

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize images for different screen sizes
- Use lazy loading for images below the fold
- Minimize HTTP requests
- Use CSS instead of JavaScript for animations when possible

Responsive design is about creating the best possible user experience across all devices.',
